# C-CPP Studies

This repository contains practical exercises and resources I used while studying C and C++.

## How to Run

To run the exercises, you'll need C/C++ installed. For C++ games, you'll also need to install the [SFML Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), and for C games, you'll need the [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). Below are instructions for setting up your workspace for the SDL2 library:

- **Windows**: [Installation Guide for SDL2 on Windows](link-to-windows-guide)
- **macOS**: [Installation Guide for SDL2 on macOS](link-to-macos-guide)
- **Linux**: [Installation Guide for SDL2 on Linux](link-to-linux-guide)

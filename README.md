# CPP Study
 
This Repository groups all my practical exercises and notes while I study C++, already having programming experience, so the basic programming stuff will not be in this repo.

## How to run on your PC

You'll only need the C++ installed, and in the games section you'll need to install the [SFML Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). <br> (I recommend you to use the [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160))

## Where to Start
First Start With the Fundamentals: [CodeCamp C++ Tutorial stuff](https://github.com/Gabriel-Spinola/CPP-Study/tree/main/CodeCamp) -> [Suraj c++ Tutorials](https://github.com/Gabriel-Spinola/CPP-Study/tree/main/Suraj-Tutorials)

after that fell free to explore the repository
